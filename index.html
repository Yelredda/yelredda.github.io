				</ul>
				<h2 style="display: inline;"> Completed </h2>
				<ul> 
					<li> <strong>WGU C867: Scripting and Programming - Applications (C++) </strong>
						<div>
						Final project for class, creating a student class scheduling application. The majority of the work is implemented in three separate classes. degree.h is a header file defining a DegreeProgram enum type. roster.h and its implementation in roster.cpp define functions for adding and removing students from a class, printing all registered students, calculating the student average number of days in their courses, validating email addresses, and printing students by degree program. student.h and student.cpp define the student class as well as a customised print() function.  
						</div>
					</li>
					<li> <strong>WGU C950: Data Structures and Algorithms II (Python) </strong>
						<div>
						Final project for class, creating a package assignment algorithm for a pseudo-truck delivery company. The package details (e.g. ID, destination, weight, deadline) are stored in instances of the Package class defined in Packages.py. The truck details (assigned packages, total miles, etc.) are stored in instances of the Truck class defined in Truck.py. The majority of the program logic is in main.py. The main program begins by importing the package and address information (used to calculate distances) from source csv files. From there, it loads the packages into the truck using specific criteria (e.g. packages with no deadline go to the truck that is leaving later, or certain packages have to be delivered as a group) coupled with a rudimentary algorithm that decides the truck's next package delivery based on which available packages are closest to its current simulated location. 
						</div>
					</li>
					<li> <strong>GT CS6035: Information to Information Security - Cryptography (Python) </strong>
						<div>
						Proof-of-concept simulations of basic ciphers and their corresponding attack vectors. Also provides an implementation of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm as a helper function for greatest common denominator calculations. Includes methods for encrypting and decrypting Vigenere ciphers, brute-force (dictionary) attacking a Vigenere cipher, encrypting and decrypting basic RSA ciphers, and attacking RSA ciphers via both Weak Key and Coppersmith/Broadcast attacks.  
						</div>
					</li>
					<li> <strong>GT CS6035: Information to Information Security - Machine Learning (Python, additional libraries: numpy, pandas, sklearn) </strong>
						<div>
						The project has multiple tasks. The first task is basic dataframe manipulation, including sorting, dropping NA rows, and inserting new columns. The second task illustrates data preprocessing using One Hot Encoding, Min/Max Scaling, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The third task uses an unsupervised K-means model to fit and train test data. The fourth task creates supervised models using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.  
						</div>
					</li>
					<li> <strong>GT CS6035: Information to Information Security - Network Capture Analysis (Python, additional libraries: pyshark) </strong>
						<div>
						This project is a basic implementation of some of the functionalities provided by the pyshark library for pcap network capture analysis. It reads a network capture (*.pcap) and has functions to return the total number of ICMP packets, the number for ICMP responses, and the most common destination MAC address seen in the capture.   
						</div>
					</li>
					<li> <strong>Server Performance Logger (Python, additional libraries: pyodbc, wmi) </strong>
						<div>
						This program was created as a simple substitute for more sophisticated monitoring software like Solarwinds. The Python program was installed as a local scheduled task on servers and would run every 10 minutes. It took advantage of the Win32_PerfRawData class to gather performance data on a per-process basis. Each server then wrote its collected data to a SQL Server database for later retrieval and analysis. It was eventually used to track down an issue where certain servers would experience degraded performance due to resource contention, and the data isolated the issue to a memory leak caused by an in-house developed application.
